TITLE_BAT1;Battle of [1066_foe_location.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DESC_BAT1;During the battle of [1066_foe_location.GetName] we have come to a narrow bridge, allowing few men to cross. One brave soldier in my ranks has managed to hold the bridge for a long time and killed 40 Englishmen. I will call him to my presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_BAT1;A fine warrior is amongst my ranks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TITLE_BAT2;Battle of [1066_foe_location.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DESC_BAT2;The King of England has offered me ransom in return for some of my prisoners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_BAT2;Arrange for the prisoner exchange;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TITLE_FOE2;Fate of England;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DESC_FOE2;With my victory over the Saxons, I, Harald 'Hårdråde', have become the King of England. Beating the Normans to the chase, I have managed to earn the respect of the Anglo-Saxon kings through pure valor. With the Godwins in the south now on the decline and the Hwicces of Mercia still left, I have to decide how I shall manage my realm.\n\nThough beaten, I technically still owe a Godwin my invasion on England, for it was Tostig who convinced me to set sail west towards the old lands of the Danelaw. Tostig was the Earl of Northumbria before he was banished by his brother Harold. Now it is up to me to decide how I will shape the future of England.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_FOE2;He can have his old lands back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
B_FOE2;Let him have it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
C_FOE2;I can compromise with him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
D_FOE2;What did he do to deserve any of this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
B_BAT2;Let them rot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TITLE_BAT3;The Prisoner Exchange;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DESC_BAT3;Hårdråde has mistakenly shown up at a small prisoner exchange, not expecting an ambush from me. I will order my archers to aim to for his head. The poor soul didn't know what I had in store for him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_BAT3;On my mark… shoot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TITLE_BAT4;The ambush at [1066_foe_location.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DESC_BAT4;The Saxons tricked me into thinking we were gonna do a real prisoner exchange, those damn bastards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_BAT4;Those Saxons Bastards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TITLE_BAT5;The ambush at [1066_foe_location.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DESC_BAT5;The Saxons tricked me into thinking we were gonna do a real prisoner exchange, despite those odds, I have managed to survive and I will show them my wrath!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_BAT5;I will show them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TITLE_BAT6;The Berserker of [1066_foe_location.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DESC_BAT6;News has reached me that the brave man from the battle at [stamford_bridge_location.GetName] has passed away from his injuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_BAT6;May god rest his soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TITLE_FOE4;England at peace;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DESC_FOE4;The King of England is once more at peace. With William's defeat, the Norman-French armies were sent back disgruntled and starving. Same with the vikings of Harald 'Hårdråde' and my brother Tostig. William will forever be know as the bastard and I am now know as the Victorious. The enemies of England now know that it is not wise to attack us, and we must take advantage of the riches that the we got from the Norwegian and Norman warchests.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon kingdom will go on to see the future and beat many more enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_FOE4;England is impervious to invaders!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TITLE_NM2;The Normans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DESC_NM2;Hroflr, also known as Rollo, has appeared at my court today. My chancellor has already informed me of his background, hearing that he even raided some of my lands before. Despite that he still requested a audience with me. He brings me an offer, similar to one which my relatives in Lotharingia have put to action, a march to defend me against viking raids. He asks not for much, only the ragged lands along the mouth of the Seine.\n\nThe vikings have been plagueing the coasts of Europe for a century, and getting someone to who is possibly the best candidate to do the job would be advantageous, however selling off my lands to a foreigner would perhaps sow discontent among my vassals. These so called Normans have alot of potential in combat, bringing their warrior culture from Scandinavia wherever they go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_NM2;I'll accept his offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
B_NM2;I have no business with brutes like him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
C_NM2;I wonder how it goes in Normandy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TITLE_NM3;The March of Normandy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DESC_NM3;[From.GetTitledName] has in an interesting turn of events decided to settle some Northmen onto French lands. [From.GetSheHe] was offered gold and protection from other raiders in return for the lands around the mouth of the Seine. The old lords of the new lands of Normandy are certainly upset at the [From.GetTitle] for selling off their lands so easily, but the first longboats of Danish and Norwegian families have already started arriving in the capital of the Normans, Rouen.\n\nHow this development will unfold is yet uncertain, but the lords of France are keeping an eye on the man responsible for much terror himself already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_NM3;Interesting…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
B_NM3;Perhaps I was destined to be a Norman?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TITLE_NM10;Words of Christ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DESC_NM10;Being a foreigner not accustomed my own lands, the people around me speak of a certain Jesus Christ. These people believe there only to be one ultimate god and that he sent his son to absolve humans of all sin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A_NM10;They make a convincing point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
B_NM10;I'll intermingle with them to understand them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
C_NM10;Odin forbid!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TITLE_NM21;Familial religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DESC_NM21;[From.GetName] has told me that he has converted to Christianity and that he got baptised by the local French bishop. It is a trend I have noticed with more of my family and court and I should keep an eye on it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A_NM21;You have seen the light!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
B_NM21;This is outrageous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TITLE_NM30;Friends up North.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DESC_NM30;The French and Normans don't seem to collaborate. Instead of  asking them to better I could ask help from Denmark, one the more prospering parts of Scandinavia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A_NM30;Send them a letter;;;;;;;;;;;;;
B_NM30;Normandy needs no help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TITLE_NM31;Norman request;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DESC_NM31;The Duke of Normandy has requested my help to help work his land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A_NM31;Ofcourse I'll help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TITLE_NM32;Reply from Denmark;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DESC_NM32;[From.GetBestName] has considered my offer, only if I give him some of my gold in return. Men from Denmark are considered hardworking and loyal so this would be a steal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A_NM32;Gladly;;;;;;;;;;;;;
B_NM32;What a ripoff!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TITLE_NM33;Worked fields;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DESC_NM33;The workers from Denmark have left and now my lands are miles better than that they used to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A_NM33;It worked out in the end!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TITLE_NM40;My Name;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DESC_NM40;My current name is of Norse origin and many French have a hard time pronouncing it, should I call myself differently?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A_NM40;Hrolfr is the best name, no?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
B_NM40;A English touch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
C_NM40;A French touch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
D_NM40;A Norman touch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TITLE_NM52;A local lord.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DESC_NM52;A lord from one of my territories came up to my court to request the right to build a castle within my domains. He brought a gift and argued that Normandy can never have enough defenses at her disposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A_NM52;I'll allow him to build here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
B_NM52;Get this ruffian out of here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TITLE_NM53;A collapsing castle;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DESC_NM53;[From.GetName] apparantly had hired very cheap workers and bought the wrong type of the stone for his castle, and now it's as good as useless. He came to me asking for funds to fix his issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A_NM53;That extra castle is usefull!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
B_NM53;He failed me, get him out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TITLE_NM54;A new lord.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DESC_NM54;[From.GetName] managed to succesfully build a castle inside of my lands. My steward inspected it and it seemed quite up to date. [From.GetBestName] did a good job even fitting the castle with military necessities;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A_NM54;More of Normandy protected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TITLE_NM60;Reaping benefits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DESC_NM60;With many people from Scandinavia flocking to Normandy for it's prosperity, new houses and other equipment is needed to keep up with the demand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A_NM60;Normandy grows ever stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TITLE_NM71;Interests in Maine;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DESC_NM71;Maine lies right south of Normandy. With Normandy's horizantal shape it would be wise to protect our most vunerable front, the south. I could ask the lord to buy some land there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A_NM71;Send my offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
B_NM71;Normandy is fine as it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TITLE_NM72;A Norman offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DESC_NM72;The Duke of Normandy, [From.GetName], has offered to buy land in Maine so he can establish a new castle there. This could open many oppertunities for vunerability and trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A_NM72;Let them come in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
B_NM72;Maine is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TITLE_NM73;Accepted offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DESC_NM73;The lord of Maine has accepted my offer and the construction of a new castle will begin immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A_NM73;Get to work boys!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TITLE_NM74;Castle in Maine;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DESC_NM74;The fortifications in Maine have been built, let's hope it holds out as intended!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A_NM74;A new asset for Normandy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DESC_NM79;[Root.GetName], I reject your offer to build a castle in my lands! Are you making a fool of me to sell my own lands to a potential foe?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A_NM79;Don't ever talk to me again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TITLE_NM75;Interests in Perche;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DESC_NM75;Perche lies right south of Normandy. With Normandy's horizantal shape it would be wise to protect our most vunerable front, the south. I could ask the lord to buy some land there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

TITLE_NM76;A Norman offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DESC_NM76;The Duke of Normandy, [From.GetName], has offered to buy land in Perche so he can establish a new castle there. This could open many oppertunities for vunerability and trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

TITLE_NM100;Land of the Normans;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DESC_NM100;Descendant from Scandinavia and settled upon French lands, the Normans have made themselves known with the reaches of Europe as formiddable warriors.\n\nWhen Hrolfr first came into contact with the King of France, no one could've predicted that he layed the ground work to alter the course of history forever. The dukes of Normandy live rich and diligent lives, maintaining the estates and land.\n\nWhere will the Normans sail to next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A_NM100;Long live Normandy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
